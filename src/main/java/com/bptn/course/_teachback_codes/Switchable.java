//We created a Switchable interface that represents any device that can be turned on.
//Both Light and Fan implement the Switchable interface, meaning they can be turned on, but they do it in their own way.
//The Switch class now depends on the Switchable interface (the abstraction), not on a specific class like Light.
//Now, the Switch can control any device that implements Switchable, whether itâ€™s a Light, Fan, or something else.
