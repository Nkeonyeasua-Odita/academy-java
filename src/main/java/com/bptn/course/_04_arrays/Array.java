		// Here's an array of high scores:
		int[] highScores = { 10, 9, 8, 15 };

		// Starting simple, we can access a variable within this array as shown above:
		System.out.println(highScores[1]); // This line will print out 9 because 9 is in the 1st index. Remember that in
											// Java, indexes start from 0, so the value at the zeroth index would be 10.

		// We can go further, though. Let's make a variable, then use it to access our
		// array:
		int here = 3; // The variable "here" now contains the value 3.

		// Now that we have an array called highScores and another variable called here,
		// we can use them together:
		System.out.println(highScores[here]);

		// The line above is effectively the same as this:
		System.out.println(highScores[3]);

		// Both lines 11 and 14 above will print out 15 because that is the element in
		// the third index of our highScores array.

		// In this line, we use can use the "here" variable to reassign the array value
		// at index 3. Again, this happens because "here" is equal to 3, but this time
		// we're using the = operator to set that index value to 11:
		highScores[here] = 11; // This rewrites the value at index 3 (the 15) with an 11.

		// What do you think the following line will print out now?
		System.out.println(highScores[here]);

		// Even with arithmetic operations, our "here" variable will still work:
		System.out.println(highScores[here - 3]); // This would print out the zeroth index because 3-3 = 0. The console
													// will show a 10 when this line runs, as that's what's in the
													// zeroth index.
		for (int i = 0; i < highScores.length; i++) {
			System.out.print(highScores[i]);
			
			System.out.println(highScores[i] + 1);
		}

	}
